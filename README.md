# Stock_trend_prediction

The goal of this project is to forecast the trends in stock prices of various firms. We aim to develop a real time model using different approaches.

Our first approach is a RNN model based approach.

Additionally, we plan to explore the theoretical aspects of Brownian motion to derive valuable insights for improving our model.
